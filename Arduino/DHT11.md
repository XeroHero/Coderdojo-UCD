# DHT 11
******

- Temperature and Humidity Sensor

- Comes in two forms: 3-pin (this is the one we will be using) and 4-pin. Both w
ork the same way. Personally, I find the 3-pin one easier to work with.

Note the labels on the pins of the DHT11. These will guide us to wire it into the Arduino Boards.

## A brief description of the pinout

The sensor has 3 pins: VCC, DATA and GND

- VCC: 5V Positive line. This provides the sensor with Power directly from the Arduino in the same way we saw last week with the LEDs.

- DATA: This is what carries our actual reading(s) from the sensor to the Arduino board.

- GND: Ground Negative line. This completes the circuit with the 5V from VCC.
